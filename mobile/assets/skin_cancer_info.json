		"name": "Actinic Keratosis",
		"description": "Actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly patch on the skin that develops from years of exposure to the sun. It is also known as solar keratosis. These patches are often found on the face, lips, ears, back of the hands, forearms, scalp, or neck. They can be a precursor to skin cancer, making it important to monitor and treat them.",
		"symptoms": "Rough, dry or scaly patch of skin less than 1 inch in diameter; flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin; in some cases, a hard, wart-like surface; color variations from pink to red to brown; itching or burning in the affected area."

	{
		"name": "Basal Cell Carcinoma",
		"description": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer, arising from the basal cells in the skin's lowest layer. It often develops on areas of the skin that receive the most sun exposure, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, shoulders, and back. BCC grows slowly and rarely metastasizes (spreads) to other parts of the body but can cause significant local damage if not treated.",
		"symptoms": "Raised, smooth, pearly bump on sun-exposed skin; small blood vessels may be visible within the tumor; a sore that heals and then reopens; a reddish patch or irritated area; a shiny bump or nodule that is pearly or translucent and is often pink, red, or white; a white, yellow, or waxy scar-like area."

	{
		"name": "Dermatofibroma",
		"description": "Dermatofibroma is a common benign fibrous nodule that most often appears on the skin of the lower legs. They are typically harmless and can develop from a minor injury, such as a bug bite or a thorn prick. Dermatofibromas are firm to the touch and can vary in color.",
		"symptoms": "Firm, small, raised nodule that may be red, brown, or purple; usually found on the legs; can be tender, itchy, or asymptomatic; often dimple inward when pinched."

		"name": "Melanoma",
		"description": "Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, originating in the melanocytes, the cells that produce the pigment melanin.

		"symptoms": "New, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole; can appear as a large brownish spot with darker speckles; a mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds; a small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, white, blue or blue-black; dark lesions on the palms, soles, fingertips, or toes, or on mucous membranes lining the mouth, nose, vagina or anus."

		"name": "Pigmented Benign Keratosis",
		"description": "Pigmented benign keratosis, also known as seborrheic keratosis, is a non-cancerous skin growth that often appears in middle-aged and older adults. These growths are typically brown, black, or light tan and have a slightly elevated, waxy, or scaly appearance.",

	{
		"name": "Squamous Cell Carcinoma",
		"description": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common form of skin cancer that arises from the squamous cells in the outer layer of the skin. It often develops on areas of the body exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, lips, and backs of the hands. SCC can grow and spread to other parts of the body if not treated promptly.",
		"symptoms": "Firm, red nodule; flat sore with a scaly crust; new sore or raised area on an old scar or ulcer; rough, scaly patch on the lip that may evolve to an open sore; red sore or rough patch inside your mouth; a red, raised patch or wart-like sore on or in the anus or on your genitals."
